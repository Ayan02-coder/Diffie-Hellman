# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

## Overview
This project implements the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.

## Features
- User input for base and modulus parameters.
- Input fields for private keys of Alice and Bob.
- Display of public keys, exchange public keys, and the shared secret key.
- Button to generate keys and compute the shared secret key.
- Animation effects for UI elements.

## How to Use
1. Open in Web browser (https://diffie-hellman-nss.netlify.app)
2. Enter values for base and modulus parameters, and private keys of Alice and Bob.
3. Click on the "Generate Keys" button.
4. Public keys, exchange public keys, and the shared secret key will be displayed.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the user interface.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the UI elements.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file containing the implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.
